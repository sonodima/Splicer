> Splice is an awesome subscription-based service that gives producers access to thousends of samples.  
This program lets you save any sound without burning any credit.
Please keep in mind this project is for educational purposes only, and you must already have a paid account in order to use it.

## Features

* Automatic audio detection
* Manual audio recording
* Drag and drop (working with any daw)
* Splice follow focus

> In the past I was working on a v2 of this project that used code injection to fetch titles of the samples, but that idea is pretty much dead.
